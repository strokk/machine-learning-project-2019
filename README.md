# GMIT - Machine Learning and Statistics - Project 2019

## Author: Guilherme G. C. Paes 


### SUMMARY ABOUT BOSTON HOUSING PROJECT

This project is being made as the final project required for GMIT's module Machine Learning and Statistics.

It concerns the Boston house prices dataset [1]. This dataset is made from a study from a US census regarding various house prices in different areas in the city of Boston, MA.

What was asked of us students, was to read about this Dataset, study it and later to compose a statistical study regaring it's variables and correlations between house prices in Boston, more specifically:

1. Focus on conducting a statistical study on the dataset, using descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston houses prices dataset.

2. Analyse the dataset using inferential statistics in order to determine differences in house prices between houses along the Charles river and those not close to the river.

3. Build a neural network model in order to predict the houses prices.


I've used multiple Python packages in this project, such as matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, keras and scikit-learn, in order to analyze the data, using descriptive and inferential statistics and later to be able to create a neural network that is able to predict the median house price based on all the other variables of the dataset.

### HOW TO RUN THE CODE

* Since this project was made using Jupyter notebook [2], you will need to have jupyter installed, in case you don't have it yet, I recommend installing Anaconda [3]. Once you have Anaconda installed, I recommend using either Firefox or Chrome, try to avoid MS Explorer. Now open your terminal (cmd on Windows) and go to the folder where you downloaded the file boston-housing.ipynb and type "jupyter notebook", this will open your browser with the current path of your folder, all you have to do now is open the file .ipynb.

* If you are having issues installing and running jupyter please refer to this tutorial [4]

* Alternatively for download, you may clone this repository from Github by typing the command below:
git clone https://github.com/strokk/machine-learning-project-2019.git
