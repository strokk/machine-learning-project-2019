    "- Descriptive: The first section will be focused on conducting a statistical study on the dataset, where I will use descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inferential: This section will be used to analyse the dataset using inferential statistics in order to determine differences in house prices betwen their location.\n",
    "- Predict: The last section will be left for the prediction, Where I will be utilizing the Python library, keras, to conduct a neural network to be able to predict the median house price\n"
